    title: "Machine Learning with Polynomials"
    excerpt: "*Polynomial regression trees* combine decision tree learning with polynomial regression, resulting in accurate yet interpretable models. The resulting models can be used for a wide range of tasks, from traditional supervised learning to uncertainty quantification."
